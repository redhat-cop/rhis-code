# Community Code of Conduct

The Ansible Community Code of Conduct emphasizes respect, patience, and inclusivity in all interactions. It encourages community members to be considerate, kind, and helpful, avoiding harassment or offensive behavior. The Code applies to all Ansible-related events, forums, and communications. Violations, including harassment, can be reported to event organizers or admins, with potential consequences like warnings or expulsion from events. The policy is designed to ensure a safe, welcoming environment for all contributors, regardless of background or skill level.
